    /*
     Quartz 2D is a two-dimensional drawing engine accessible in the
     iOS environment and from all Mac OS X application environments
     outside of the kernel. You can use the Quartz 2D application
     programming interface(API) to gain access to features such as
     path-based drawing, painting with transparency, shading, drawing
     shadows, transparency layers, color management, anti-aliased rendering,
     PDF document generation, and PDF metadata access. Whenever possible,
     Quartz 2D leverages the power of the graphics hardware.
     
     In Mac OS X, Quartz 2D can work with all other graphics and
     imaging technologies -- Core Image, Core Video, OpenGL, and
     QuickTime. It's possible to create an image in Quartz from
     a QuickTime graphic importer, using the QuickTime function
     GraphicsImportCreateCGImage. See QuickTime Framework Reference
     for details. Moving Data Between Quartz 2D and Core Image in
     Mac OS X describes how you can provide images to Core Image,
     which is a framework that supports image processing.

     Similarly, in iOS, Quartz 2D works with all available graphics
     and animation technologies, such as Core Animation, OpenGL
     ES, and the UIKit classes.

    /**
     The Page

     Quartz 2D uses the painter’s model for its imaging. In the
     painter’s model, each successive drawing operation applies
     a layer of “paint” to an output “canvas,” often called a
     page. The paint on the page can be modified by overlaying
     more paint through additional drawing operations. An object
     drawn on the page cannot be modified except by overlaying
     more paint. This model allows you to construct extremely
     sophisticated images from a small number of powerful
     primitives.

     Figure 1-1 shows how the painter’s model works. To get the
     image in the top part of the figure, the shape on the
     left was drawn first followed by the solid shape. The
     solid shape overlays the first shape, obscuring all but
     the perimeter of the first shape. The shapes are drawn
     in the opposite order in the bottom of the figure, with
     the solid shape drawn first. As you can see, in the
     painter’s model the drawing order is important.

     The page may be a real sheet of paper (if the output
     device is a printer); it may be a virtual sheet of paper
     (if the output device is a PDF file); it may even be a
     bitmap image. The exact nature of the page depends on
     the particular graphics context you use.
     */
    
    /**
     Drawing Destinations: The Graphics Context

     A graphics context is an opaque data type (CGContextRef)
     that encapsulates the information Quartz uses to draw
     images to an output device, such as a PDF file, a bitmap,
     or a window on a display. The information inside a graphics
     context includes graphics drawing parameters and a
     device-specific representation of the paint on the page.
     All objects in Quartz are drawn to, or contained by, a
     graphics context.

     You can think of a graphics context as a drawing destination,
     as shown in Figure 1-2. When you draw with Quartz, all
     device-specific characteristics are contained within the
     specific type of graphics context you use. In other words,
     you can draw the same image to a different device simply
     by providing a different graphics context to the same
     sequence of Quartz drawing routines. You do not need to
     perform any device-specific calculations; Quartz does it
     for you.

     Figure 1-2  Quartz drawing destinations
     file:///Users/tigerfly/Desktop/CoreGraphics/CoreGraphics/QuartzCore/draw_destinations.gif
     
     These graphics contexts are available to your application:
     •  A bitmap graphics context allows you to paint RGB colors,
        CMYK colors, or grayscale into a bitmap. A bitmap is a
        rectangular array (or raster) of pixels, each pixel
        representing a point in an image. Bitmap images are also
        called sampled images. See Creating a Bitmap Graphics Context.
     •  A PDF graphics context allows you to create a PDF file. In
        a PDF file, your drawing is preserved as a sequence of
        commands. There are some significant differences between
        PDF files and bitmaps:
        ‣   PDF files, unlike bitmaps, may contain more than one page.
        ‣   When you draw a page from a PDF file on a different device,
            the resulting image is optimized for the display characteristics
            of that device.
        ‣   PDF files are resolution independent by nature—the size at
            which they are drawn can be increased or decreased infinitely
            without sacrificing image detail. The user-perceived quality
            of a bitmap image is tied to the resolution at which the bitmap
            is intended to be viewed.
     •  A window graphics context is a graphics context that you can use
        to draw into a window. Note that because Quartz 2D is a graphics
        engine and not a window management system, you use one of the
        application frameworks to obtain a graphics context for a window.
        See Creating a Window Graphics Context in Mac OS X for details.
     •  A layer context (CGLayerRef) is an offscreen drawing destination
        associated with another graphics context. It is designed for
        optimal performance when drawing the layer to the graphics
        context that created it. A layer context can be a much better
        choice for offscreen drawing than a bitmap graphics context.
        See Core Graphics Layer Drawing.
     •  When you want to print in Mac OS X, you send your content to
        a PostScript graphics context that is managed by the printing
        framework. See Obtaining a Graphics Context for Printing for
        more information.

    /**
     Quartz 2D Opaque Data Types

     The Quartz 2D API defines a variety of opaque data types in
     addition to graphics contexts. Because the API is part of the
     Core Graphics framework, the data types and the routines that
     operate on them use the CG prefix.

     Quartz 2D creates objects from opaque data types that your
     application operates on to achieve a particular drawing output.
     Figure 1-3 shows the sorts of results you can achieve when you
     apply drawing operations to three of the objects provided by
     Quartz 2D. For example:
     
     •  You can rotate and display a PDF page by creating a PDF
        page object, applying a rotation operation to the graphics
        context, and asking Quartz 2D to draw the page to a graphics context.
     •  You can draw a pattern by creating a pattern object,
        defining the shape that makes up the pattern, and setting
        up Quartz 2D to use the pattern as paint when it draws to
        a graphics context.
     •  You can fill an area with an axial or radial shading by
        creating a shading object, providing a function that determines
        the color at each point in the shading, and then asking Quartz
        2D to use the shading as a fill color.
        Figure 1-3  Opaque data types are the basis of drawing primitives
        in Quartz 2D
        file:///Users/tigerfly/Desktop/CoreGraphics/CoreGraphics/QuartzCore/drawing_primitives.gif
     
     The opaque data types available in Quartz 2D include the following:
     •  CGPathRef, used for vector graphics to create paths that you fill or stroke.
     •  CGImageRef, used to represent bitmap images and bitmap image
        masks based on sample data that you supply.
     •  CGLayerRef, used to represent a drawing layer that can be used
        for repeated drawing (such as for backgrounds or patterns)
        and for offscreen drawing.
     •  CGPatternRef, used for repeated drawing.
     •  CGShadingRef and CGGradientRef, used to paint gradients.
     •  CGFunctionRef, used to define callback functions that take an
        arbitrary number of floating-point arguments. You use this data
        type when you create gradients for a shading.
     •  CGColorRef and CGColorSpaceRef, used to inform Quartz how to
        interpret color.
     •  CGImageSourceRef and CGImageDestinationRef, which you use to
        move data into and out of Quartz.
     •  CGFontRef, used to draw text.
     •  CGPDFDictionaryRef, CGPDFObjectRef, CGPDFPageRef, CGPDFStream,
        CGPDFStringRef, and CGPDFArrayRef, which provide access to PDF metadata.
     •  CGPDFScannerRef and CGPDFContentStreamRef, which parse PDF metadata.
     •  CGPSConverterRef, used to convert PostScript to PDF. It is not available in iOS.
     */
    
    
    /**
     Graphics States
     
     Quartz modifies the results of drawing operations according to
     the parameters in the current graphics state. The graphics state
     contains parameters that would otherwise be taken as arguments
     to drawing routines. Routines that draw to a graphics context
     consult the graphics state to determine how to render their
     results. For example, when you call a function to set the fill
     color, you are modifying a value stored in the current graphics
     state. Other commonly used elements of the current graphics
     state include the line width, the current position, and the
     text font size.

     The graphics context contains a stack of graphics states.
     When Quartz creates a graphics context, the stack is empty.
     When you save the graphics state, Quartz pushes a copy of
     the current graphics state onto the stack. When you restore
     the graphics state, Quartz pops the graphics state off the
     top of the stack. The popped state becomes the current
     graphics state.

     To save the current graphics state, use the function
     CGContextSaveGState to push a copy of the current graphics
     state onto the stack. To restore a previously saved
     graphics state, use the function CGContextRestoreGState
     to replace the current graphics state with the graphics
     state that’s on top of the stack.

     Note that not all aspects of the current drawing environment
     are elements of the graphics state. For example, the
     current path is not considered part of the graphics state
     and is therefore not saved when you call the function
     CGContextSaveGState. The graphics state parameters that
     are saved when you call this function are listed in Table 1-1.

    /**
     Quartz 2D Coordinate Systems

     A coordinate system, shown in Figure 1-4, defines the range
     of locations used to express the location and sizes of
     objects to be drawn on the page. You specify the location
     and size of graphics in the user-space coordinate system,
     or, more simply, the user space. Coordinates are defined as
     floating-point values.

     Figure 1-4  The Quartz coordinate system
     file:///Users/tigerfly/Desktop/CoreGraphics/CoreGraphics/QuartzCore/quartz_coordinates.gif
     
     Because different devices have different underlying imaging
     capabilities, the locations and sizes of graphics must be
     defined in a device-independent manner. For example, a screen
     display device might be capable of displaying no more than
     96 pixels per inch, while a printer might be capable of
     displaying 300 pixels per inch. If you define the coordinate
     system at the device level (in this example, either 96 pixels
     or 300 pixels), objects drawn in that space cannot be
     reproduced on other devices without visible distortion.
     They will appear too large or too small.

     Quartz accomplishes device independence with a separate
     coordinate system—user space—mapping it to the coordinate
     system of the output device—device space—using the current
     transformation matrix, or CTM. A matrix is a mathematical
     construct used to efficiently describe a set of related
     equations. The current transformation matrix is a particular
     type of matrix called an affine transform, which maps points
     from one coordinate space to another by applying translation,
     rotation, and scaling operations (calculations that move,
     rotate, and resize a coordinate system).

     The current transformation matrix has a secondary purpose:
     It allows you to transform how objects are drawn. For example,
     to draw a box rotated by 45 degrees, you rotate the
     coordinate system of the page (the CTM) before you draw the
     box. Quartz draws to the output device using the rotated
     coordinate system.

     A point in user space is represented by a coordinate pair
     (x,y), where x represents the location along the horizontal
     axis (left and right) and y represents the vertical axis
     (up and down). The origin of the user coordinate space is
     the point (0,0). The origin is located at the lower-left
     corner of the page, as shown in Figure 1-4. In the default
     coordinate system for Quartz, the x-axis increases as it
     moves from the left toward the right of the page. The y-axis
     increases in value as it moves from the bottom toward the
     top of the page.

     Some technologies set up their graphics contexts using a
     different default coordinate system than the one used by
     Quartz. Relative to Quartz, such a coordinate system is
     a modified coordinate system and must be compensated for
     when performing some Quartz drawing operations. The most
     common modified coordinate system places the origin in
     the upper-left corner of the context and changes the y-axis
     to point towards the bottom of the page. A few places
     where you might see this specific coordinate system
     used are the following:
     •  In Mac OS X, a subclass of NSView that overrides its
        isFlipped method to return YES.
     •  In iOS, a drawing context returned by an UIView.
     •  In iOS, a drawing context created by calling the
        UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions function.
     
     The reason UIKit returns Quartz drawing contexts with modified
     coordinate systems is that UIKit uses a different default
     coordinate convention; it applies the transform to Quartz
     contexts it creates so that they match its conventions. If
     your application wants to use the same drawing routines to
     draw to both a UIView object and a PDF graphics context
     (which is created by Quartz and uses the default coordinate
     system), you need to apply a transform so that the PDF
     graphics context receives the same modified coordinate
     system. To do this, apply a transform that translates
     the origin to the upper-left corner of the PDF context
     and scales the y-coordinate by -1.

     Using a scaling transform to negate the y-coordinate
     alters some conventions in Quartz drawing. For example,
     if you call CGContextDrawImage to draw an image into the
     context, the image is modified by the transform when it
     is drawn into the destination. Similarly, path drawing
     routines accept parameters that specify whether an arc
     is drawn in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction in
     the default coordinate system. If a coordinate system is
     modified, the result is also modified, as if the image
     were reflected in a mirror. In Figure 1-5, passing the
     same parameters into Quartz results in a clockwise arc in
     the default coordinate system and a counterclockwise arc
     after the y-coordinate is negated by the transform.
     
     Figure 1-5  Modifying the coordinate system creates a mirrored image.
     file:///Users/tigerfly/Desktop/CoreGraphics/CoreGraphics/QuartzCore/flipped_coordinates.jpg
     
     It is up to your application to adjust any Quartz calls it
     makes to a context that has a transform applied to it. For
     example, if you want an image or PDF to draw correctly into
     a graphics context, your application may need to temporarily
     adjust the CTM of the graphics context. In iOS, if you use
     a UIImage object to wrap a CGImage object you create, you do
     not need to modify the CTM. The UIImage object automatically
     compensates for the modified coordinate system applied by UIKit.
     
     ⚠️ The above discussion is essential to understand if you
        plan to write applications that directly target Quartz on
        iOS, but it is not sufficient. On iOS 3.2 and later, when
        UIKit creates a drawing context for your application, it also
        makes additional changes to the context to match the default
        UIKIt conventions. In particular, patterns and shadows, which
        are not affected by the CTM, are adjusted separately so that
        their conventions match UIKit’s coordinate system. In this case,
        there is no equivalent mechanism to the CTM that your application
        can use to change a context created by Quartz to match the
        behavior for a context provided by UIKit; your application must
        recognize the what kind of context it is drawing into and adjust
        its behavior to match the expectations of the context.
     */
    
    
    /**
     Memory Management: Object Ownership

     Quartz uses the Core Foundation memory management model, in
     which objects are reference counted. When created, Core
     Foundation objects start out with a reference count of 1.
     You can increment the reference count by calling a function
     to retain the object, and decrement the reference count by
     calling a function to release the object. When the reference
     count is decremented to 0, the object is freed. This model
     allows objects to safely share references to other objects.

     There are a few simple rules to keep in mind:

     •  If you create or copy an object, you own it, and therefore
        you must release it. That is, in general, if you obtain an
        object from a function with the words “Create” or “Copy” in
        its name, you must release the object when you’re done with it.
        Otherwise, a memory leak results.
     •  If you obtain an object from a function that does not contain
        the words “Create” or “Copy” in its name, you do not own a
        reference to the object, and you must not release it. The
        object will be released by its owner at some point in the future.
     •  If you do not own an object and you need to keep it around,
        you must retain it and release it when you’re done with it.
        You use the Quartz 2D functions specific to an object to retain
        and release that object. For example, if you receive a reference
        to a CGColorspace object, you use the functions CGColorSpaceRetain
        and CGColorSpaceRelease to retain and release the object as needed.
        You can also use the Core Foundation functions CFRetain and
        CFRelease, but you must be careful not to pass NULL to these
        functions.
