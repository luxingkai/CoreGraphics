     Make large-scale mathematical computations and image calculations,
     optimized for high performance and low-energy consumption.
     
     Accelerate provides high-performance, energy-efficient computation
     on the CPU by leveraging its vector-processing capability.
     The following Accelerate libraries abstract that capability so
     that code written for them executes appropriate instructions
     for the processor available at runtime:
     
     •  BNNS. Subroutines for constructing and running neural networks
        for both training and inference.
     •  vImage. A wide range of image-processing functions, including Core
        Graphics and Core Video interoperation, format conversion, and
        image manipulation.
     •  vDSP. Digital signal processing functions, including 1D and 2D
        fast Fourier transforms, biquadratic filtering, vector and matrix
        arithmetic, convolutionm and type conversion.
     •  vForce. Functions for performing arithmetic and transcendental functions
        on vectors.
     •  Sparse Solvers, BLAS, and LAPACK. Libraries for performing linear
        algebra on sparse and dense matrices.
    
     Although not part of the Accelerate framework, the following libraries are
     closely related:
     •  Apple Archive. A framework for performing multithreaded lossless compression
        of directories, files, and data.
     •  Compression. Algorithms for lossless data compression that support LZFSE,
        LZ4, LZMA, and ZLIB algorithms.
     •  simd. A module for performing computations on small vectors and matrices.
